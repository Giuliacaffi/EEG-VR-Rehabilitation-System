abstract: >
  A human-centered, multi-level neurorehabilitation framework integrating EEG-based motor intention decoding with immersive Virtual Reality environments. 
  The system combines offline calibration, real-time classification, adaptive progression logic, and multimodal extensions 
  (EEG + EMG + IMU) to support both assistive and rehabilitative neurotechnology applications.
